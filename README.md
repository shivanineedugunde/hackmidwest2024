This platform connects the students in need of items to those students that possess the items but do not need them. 
The students who want to sell or donate their items can post the product details on the application along with contact information. 
The students who want to get items can browse through the available products and choose the required one and use the contact information provided by the owner to make a deal with them.
This application can be implemented in such a way that it is used only among the people belonging to a specific college to ensure convenient trading![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0685ada8-13a5-4f36-810f-f11f343d6633)
